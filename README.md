## Description

**LogGuard** is a lightweight, modular, and beginner-friendly Python tool designed to analyze Linux system authentication logs.

Its goal is to help identify suspicious login activity such as failed SSH attempts, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation commands (`sudo`, `su`) by parsing real system logs (`/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`, or custom files).

Originally created as a learning project to explore Python and system log parsing, LogGuard now serves as a solid base for anyone who wants to:
- Understand how authentication events are logged on Linux
- Build simple tools for threat detection or audit purposes
- Practice Python coding in a real-world context

The code is clean and modular, making it easy to extend or integrate into larger security tools.

<br>

## Features

✅ **Current capabilities**:
- Auto-detects standard Linux authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`)
- Supports custom log file path with `--custom-log`
- Parses SSH failed login attempts
- Extracts timestamp, username, and source IP from log entries
- Displays failed SSH login attempts in a readable format
- Detection of successful SSH logins

🛠️ **Work in progress**:
- Detection of `sudo` and `su` usage (privilege escalation)
- Summary statistics: attempts per IP, per user, per day
- Export to JSON or CSV
- HTML report generation (future)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RikoRiken/LogGuard.git
cd LogGuard
```
<br>

2. **Run the tool**:
```bash
python3 LogGuard.py


# 💡 You can also specify a custom log file:

python3 LogGuard.py --custom-log path/to/custom_file.log
```
<br>

3. *(Optionnal)* **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source /venv/bin/active
```
