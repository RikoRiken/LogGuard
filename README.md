## Description

**LogGuard** is a lightweight, modular, and beginner-friendly Python tool designed to analyze Linux system authentication logs.

Its goal is to help identify suspicious login activity â€” such as failed SSH attempts, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation commands (e.g., `sudo`, `su`) â€” by parsing real system logs (`/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`, or custom files).

Originally created as a learning project to explore Python and system log parsing, LogGuard now serves as a solid base for anyone who wants to:
- Understand how authentication events are logged on Linux
- Build simple tools for threat detection or audit purposes
- Practice Python coding in a real-world context

The code is clean and modular, making it easy to extend or integrate into larger security tools.
